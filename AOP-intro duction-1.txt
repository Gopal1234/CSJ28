What is Aspect Oriented Programming:

Answer:AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns

AOP breaks the program logic into individual distinct part , i. e. called concern

It does this by adding additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself.

It provides the pluggable way to dynamically add the additional concern before, after or around the actual logic

consider a 

class LoggerReport
{

public void startUSAServer()
{


}
public void startIndianServer()
{


}
public void startEuropianServer()
{


}


}

Understanding senario:

I have to maintain log and send notification after calling methods 


Problem without AOP:
We can call methods (that maintains log and sends notification) from the methods starting with m. In such scenario, we need to write the code in all  methods


Solution with AOP We don't have to call methods from the method. Now we can define the additional concern like maintaining log, sending notification etc. in the method of a class.

n future, if client says to remove the notifier functionality, we need to change only class file. So, maintenance is easy in AOP.


A cross-cutting concern is a concern that can affect the whole application and should be centralized in one location in code as possible, such as transaction management, authentication, logging, security etc.
